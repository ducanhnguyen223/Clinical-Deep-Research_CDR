# LLM providers

CDR runs on any of eight hosted providers, or on a local model. You need **one**. Set its key in
`.env` and, if you like, pick it with `LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`. CDR tries that provider first and
falls back through any others that are configured.

```bash
make check-env    # tells you whether a usable key is present
```

## Which one should I use?

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Just want to see it run | **Gemini**. Check current model access and pricing for your account. |
| Want speed | **Groq** or **Cerebras**. Compare the current model and account limits before a full run. |
| No quota, no key, full control | **A local model** through Ollama, vLLM or LM Studio (below). |
| Need the best output quality and don't mind paying | **OpenAI** or **Anthropic**, or a large model via **OpenRouter** |

A full pipeline run makes dozens of LLM calls. Cost, availability, and rate limits depend on the
provider, model, and account; check those before running a large batch.

## Setup

| Provider | `.env` | Get a key | Default model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) | https://aistudio.google.com/apikey | `gemini-3.8-flash` |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | https://console.groq.com/keys | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` |
| Cerebras | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | https://cloud.cerebras.ai | `qwen-3.8-27b` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | https://openrouter.ai/keys | `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → AI | `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b` |
| Hugging Face | `HF_TOKEN` (optional `HF_ENDPOINT_URL`) | https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | https://platform.openai.com/api-keys | `gpt-4o` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | https://console.anthropic.com | set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |

The Anthropic default is intentionally unchanged and was not re-audited here because it is tied to
the SDK migration in [#119](https://github.com/BlueRingsLabs/Clinical-Deep-Research_CDR/issues/119).

Google currently recommends Gemini 3.8 Flash and 3.5 Flash-Lite for new projects and limits access
to Gemini 2.5 models to users who actively used them before. Gemini 3.x requests also omit legacy
sampling parameters. Check [Google's model catalog](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)
and [Gemini 3 migration notes](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/latest-model) for current
availability and request requirements. Defaults live in `src/cdr/llm/*_provider.py` and
`src/cdr/config.py`; providers deprecate models regularly.
If a default starts returning 404s, that's a
[good first issue](https://github.com/BlueRingsLabs/Clinical-Deep-Research_CDR/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

## Local models (no key, no quota)

The `openai` provider can talk to any OpenAI-compatible server. With [Ollama](https://ollama.com):

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

```dotenv
LLM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

vLLM (`http://localhost:8000/v1`, so run CDR's API on another port), LM Studio
(`http://localhost:1234/v1`) and `llama.cpp`'s server work the same way. No `OPENAI_API_KEY` is
needed when `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set.

A warning about small models: 8B models get through the pipeline but produce thinner claims and
fail more verification checks. The bundled online runs were made with 8B models on purpose, to
show the floor rather than the ceiling.

## Known failure modes

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP 402 | Out of credits (Hugging Face, OpenRouter) | Add credits or switch provider |
| HTTP 429 / quota message | Provider or account rate limit | Wait, check the account's quota, or switch provider |
| HTTP 404 on the model | Provider retired the model | Set the model env var to a current one, and open an issue |
| Run finishes as `unpublishable` | The evidence didn't pass the gates | Working as intended. Read `status_reason` in the report |

The fallback factory skips providers that have no key configured. The Hugging Face provider
retries only transient errors (429, 5xx) and fails fast on a 402.

## Adding a provider

1. Create `src/cdr/llm/<name>_provider.py` subclassing `BaseLLMProvider` (see `base.py`).
2. Register it in `src/cdr/llm/factory.py` (`create_provider` and the fallback order) and add its
   settings to `src/cdr/config.py`.
3. Add its env vars to `.env.example` and a row to the table above.
4. Add tests with the HTTP layer mocked. Tests must never hit the network.

If the provider speaks the OpenAI API, you may not need any of this. Try `OPENAI_BASE_URL` first.
